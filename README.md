## I am Scotch101Tape

I enjoy coding to learn and for fun. I especially ❤️ the ability that programming gives you to create what you desire.

I have programmed 📜 in several langauges with varying degrees of ability including Lua, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Julia, C, C++, and Solidity.

Currently, I am not focused on programming, but still will make the occasional commit 💻.

I am also on Discord 👾 `scotch101tape#9577`.
